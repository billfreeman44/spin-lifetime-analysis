# Spin lifetime analysis

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/evansosenko/spin-lifetime-analysis.svg)](./LICENSE.txt)

## Requirements

- [Python 3](http://www.python.org/)
  with [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/).

## Setup

Install the required Python packages with

````bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Depending on how your system is configured:

* You may need to run this commands with `sudo`.
* You may want to install the core SciPy packages via your package manager.
* You may want to use [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/).

## Usage

Execute the analysis with

````bash
$ make
````

Output will be saved in the `build` directory.

Python output will be redirected to `stdout.log`
and errors to `stderr.log`.

Remove the build and logs with

````bash
$ make clean
````

Serve the build directory from a local http server on port `8000` with

````bash
$ make serve
````

## Viewing fits with Fitalyzer.

After generating fits with `make`, run `make serve` and load
[io.evansosenko.com/fitalyzer/?firebase=spin-lifetime&port=8000&path=/fitalyzer](http://io.evansosenko.com/fitalyzer/?firebase=spin-lifetime&port=8000&path=/fitalyzer).

Note: you must visit [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000)
